# 🦉 CustomFlow

**A minimalist task manager for those whose "today" doesn't end at midnight.**

---

### ✨ Key Features
* **Custom Day Reset:** Set your own "start" and "end" times (e.g., 3:00 AM).
* **Always on Top:** Keep your list pinned for zero-distraction productivity.
* **Minimalist Design:** Easy-on-the-eyes dark mode for late-night sessions.
* **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally on your machine.

### 🚀 Getting Started
### How to Install For Regular Users (Windows)
1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/UniversalStacker/CustomFlow/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** page.
2. Download `CustomFlow.exe`.
3. Run and enjoy your day!
> **Note:** Since this is an independent project, Windows may show a "SmartScreen" warning. Click *More Info* -> *Run Anyway*.
### ⚙️ Configuration 
* **Start Time: When your "productivity day" begins.
* **End Time: The "cutoff" point. If it's 2:00 AM and your cutoff is 4:00 AM, the app still considers it "today."
